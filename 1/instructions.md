In this hike we'll be demonstrating how to clean up a portion of text. This is 
useful for web scraping.

If you have a look at the code window, you'll see the text we'll be working with.

We'll clean up the text in these ways:

1. Remove the HTML tags
2. Remove extra whitespace between words
3. Correctly capitalise the first word of each sentence, lowercase all other letters

We'll be adding to a single function called `cleanup()`. In the first step your task is to 
remove the tags from the string.
